## Motivation

Most existing apps to help photographers with long exposures are paid ones.
Using a de-googled phone includes having no Play-Store available
to purchase/install those apps. There are options to purchase and install paid apps, 
but you still need to use a Google Account which I like to avoid. There are also several
web based tools available, but I haven't found any I really liked.
A second motivation is to learn and gain some experience with a RUST frontend framework 
that compiles to WASM (in this case Dioxus).
